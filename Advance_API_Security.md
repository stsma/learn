### API vs Service

- An API is the interface
between two parties or two components.
- A service is a concrete implementation of an API using one of the technologies/standards available.

Today, the topic of API vs. service is debatable, because there are many overlapping areas. One popular definition
is that an API is external facing whereas a service is internal facing (see image below). An enterprise uses an API
whenever it wants to expose useful business functionality to the outside world through the firewall.
